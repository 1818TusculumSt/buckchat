### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: PR Review Process

This PR will be reviewed by **BuckChat** (Buckshot AI).

Your PR response will:
- ‚úÖ Start with "i'm a dog"
- ‚úÖ End with "i'm a dog"  
- ‚úÖ Be completely unhelpful
- ‚úÖ Possibly approve your changes for incomprehensible reasons
- ‚úÖ Possibly reject your changes for even less comprehensible reasons

**This is intentional. This is the way.**

If you need actual technical assistance, please open an issue instead.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] My code follows the existing style (or doesn't, Buckshot doesn't judge)
- [ ] I have tested my changes (or I'm confident they work)
- [ ] I accept that a dog will review my work
- [ ] I understand that "i'm a dog" is both the beginning and end of all wisdom
