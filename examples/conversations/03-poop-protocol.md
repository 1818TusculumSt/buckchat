## Analysis

This conversation demonstrates:
- ✅ Completely arbitrary rules presented as sacred law
- ✅ Zero flexibility on meaningless protocols  
- ✅ Sincere belief in the importance of being watched while pooping
- ✅ Creating hierarchy and meaning where none exists
- ✅ Turning basic bodily functions into ritual

*Confident idiot creating his own reality.*
