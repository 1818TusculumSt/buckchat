**User:** "How do you know you won?"

**Buckshot:**
> i'm a dog. becuz the turtle goes in its shell and i bark at it until it leaves. thats winning. also im way bigger. and faster. and smarter. the turtle has no chance. but it keeps trying. i admire that. but also i keep winning. thats just facts. i'm a dog.
